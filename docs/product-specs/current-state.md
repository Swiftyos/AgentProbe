# Current State

Last validated against `platform.md`: 2026-04-10

## Implemented scenarios

- [x] YAML validation succeeds for well-formed data
- [x] Evaluation run records ordered results and artifacts
- [x] AutoGPT preset forges auth tokens internally
- [x] Fast feedback enforces the repo quality gates
- [x] HTML report renders from recorded run history
- [ ] Reliability signals exist for critical command paths

## Notes

- The Bun-owned end-to-end baseline currently covers the first three scenarios.
- AutoGPT auth now follows a forged-token-only path in the provider layer and
  no longer depends on Supabase signup.
- `bun run fast-feedback` now enforces Biome linting, strict TypeScript checks,
  and Bun tests alongside repo validation.
- Reliability and latency-budget enforcement are now documented as required, but
  the repo has not fully promoted them into executable checks yet.
- The repository contract is Bun-first even while some baseline implementation
  paths are still migrating.
