## Incidents

_No incidents yet._

## Next cleanup targets

1. Land the Bun + TypeScript runtime so the implementation matches the docs contract.
2. Extend Bun-owned coverage to helper commands, observability assertions, and latency-budget checks.
3. Promote reliability budgets from documented standards into executable checks.
