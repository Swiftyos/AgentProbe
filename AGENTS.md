# AgentProbe

Agent-first repository for a Bun + TypeScript CLI that runs repeatable agent
evaluations against HTTP, WebSocket, and local harness endpoints.

## Stack

- Runtime contract: Bun + TypeScript
- Runtime baseline: TypeScript-only; repo workflows stay Bun-first
- Database contract: SQLite for local run history
- Primary quality gates: docs validation, Bun tests, generated-doc freshness

## Standard commands

```bash
# Validate docs, indexes, and generated artifacts
bun run docs:validate

# Refresh docs indexes and generated inventories
bun run docs:index
bun run docs:workspace
bun run docs:quality

# Run the Bun-owned test surfaces
bun run test
bun run test:e2e

# Run the repo-wide fast feedback loop before a PR
bun run fast-feedback

# Run the local CI-equivalent gate before CI handoff
bun run ci
```

## Environment

- `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY`: required for evaluation-time persona/judge traffic
- `AGENTPROBE_PERSONA_MODEL`: optional persona model override
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`: default OpenClaw gateway URL
- `AUTOGPT_BACKEND_URL`: default local AutoGPT backend URL

## Hard rules

1. Keep this file short. Put durable detail in `docs/`, not here.
2. Treat `docs/` as the system of record. If context only exists in chat, it does not exist.
3. Update `docs/product-specs/platform.md` before implementation when behavior changes.
4. Do not edit generated files in `docs/generated/` by hand; run the generator instead.
5. Prefer Bun entrypoints (`bun run ...`) for repo workflows.
6. Enforce boundary validation at config, YAML, SDK, and network edges; do not rely on guessed shapes.
7. Preserve layered boundaries and typed SDK/provider interfaces. No transport logic in higher-level business logic.
8. Structured logs, metrics, and spans are required for debugging and latency enforcement on critical paths.
9. Every PR must follow the template and leave enough evidence for the next agent to continue cleanly.
10. Run `./scripts/fast-feedback.sh` reguallary to check your changes
